NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of people who  have  been  added  to
  Friendbook.

===============
  FbUnfriend
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(1)

- Explanation: There are no while / for loops and all lines are either assignments or comparisons which have complexity O(1).

===============
FbMutualFriends
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: There is a while loop in this function.

===============
 FbFriendRecs1
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^3)

- Explanation: FbMutualFriends is called within a while loop, FbMutualFriends has worst case time complexity of n. Since it is inside a nested while loop, the overall
  worst case time complexity is (n^3).
