Question 3

Note: if you need to promote a value, you must promote the smaller 
value from the available alternatives (if any). Justify your answer.

(a) 
(a1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 8? 
     Justify your answer.

12, 35, 60 - unchanged
This is because 8 will be inserted to the left most node on the bottom

(a2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 8? 
     Justify your answer.

1, 7, 8
8 Will be inserted into the left most node at the bottom, since it is higher than 7,
it will be on the right of 7

(b) 
(b1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 50? 
     Justify your answer.

12, 35, 44
44 Will be promoted to the root node, since 44 is higher than 35 it will be on the right

(b2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 50? 
     Justify your answer.

36, 50, 57
Since 50 is between 36 and 57 (in terms of value) it will be placed between them in the tree.
