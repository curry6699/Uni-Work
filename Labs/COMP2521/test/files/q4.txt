Question 4

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.

Creating a heap takes O(n)
Push: Inserting into a heap takes O(log(n))
Pop: Deleting the highest priority takes  O(log(n))
Print: Printing takes O(nlog(n))

Heap is better overall than the other structures.
